## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
  in this project, I have met with some libraries like [react responsive](https://contra.io/react-responsive/) and [react testing library](https://testing-library.com/) 
 and I have learned how to fetch data with redux toolkit by create async thunk function 

 ### Continued development

I'll focus in the future on JS local storage
